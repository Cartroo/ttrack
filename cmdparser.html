<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser</tt> package contains two modules which are useful for writing
text command parsers, particularly using the builtin Python <tt class="docutils literal">cmd</tt> module.</p>
<p>The package consists of two modules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">datetimeparse</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>These two modules are discussed below briefly. For more information see the
docstrings of the two modules, and also the <tt class="docutils literal">ttrack</tt> command-line application
(from which these libraries originated) makes a good example of their use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Install the <tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser</tt> package from PyPI. For example, to install using
<tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pip install ttrack
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h1>cmdparser</h1>
<p>This module allows the creation of parse trees from textual command
specifications of the following form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ham ( eggs | chips [spam] | beans [spam [...]] )
</pre>
<p>These parse trees can then be used to check for matches against particular
command strings, and also allow valid completions of partial command strings to
be listed. To build a parse tree and use it in a few examples, see the
following example code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/python

from cmdparser import cmdparser

parse_tree = cmdparser.parse_spec(&quot;one (two|three) &lt;four&gt; [five]&quot;)

# Returns None to indicate successful parse
parse_tree.check_match((&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;anything&quot;))
# Returns an appropriate parsing error message
parse_tree.check_match((&quot;one&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;anything&quot;, &quot;six&quot;))
# Returns the list [&quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]
parse_tree.get_completions((&quot;one&quot;,))
</pre>
<p>As well as dealing with fixed token strings, dynamic tokens can also be set up
where the list of strings accepted can change over time, or where arbitrary
strings or lists of strings can be accepted. See the module's docstrings for
specifics of the classes available, but as an example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/python

from cmdparser import cmdparser

class ColourToken(cmdparser.Token):
    def get_values(self, context):
        # Static list here, but could easily be dynamic
        return [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;]

def my_ident_factory(token):
    if token == &quot;number&quot;:
        return cmdparser.IntegerToken(token)
    elif token == &quot;colour&quot;:
        return ColourToken(token)
    return None

parse_tree = cmdparser.parse_tree(&quot;take &lt;number&gt; &lt;colour&gt; balls&quot;,
                                  ident_factory=my_ident_factory)

# Returns None to indicate successful parse, and the &quot;cmd_fields&quot; dict will
# be initialised as:
# { &quot;take&quot;: [&quot;take&quot;], &quot;&lt;number&gt;&quot;: [&quot;23&quot;],
#   &quot;&lt;colour&gt;&quot;: [&quot;blue&quot;], &quot;balls&quot;: [&quot;balls&quot;] }
cmd_fields = {}
parse_tree.check_match((&quot;take&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;balls&quot;), fields=cmd_fields)
# Returns an appropriate parsing error message
parse_tree.check_match((&quot;take&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;balls&quot;))
# Returns the list [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, ..., &quot;purple&quot;]
parse_tree.get_completions((&quot;take&quot;, &quot;5&quot;))
</pre>
<p>There are three classes which are suitable base classes for user-derived
tokens:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Token</tt></dt>
<dd>This is useful for cases where one of a set of fixed values is suitable,
where the list may be fixed or dynamic. The <tt class="docutils literal">get_values()</tt> method should be
overridden to return a list of valid tokens as strings. Optionally, there is
also a <tt class="docutils literal">convert()</tt> method which can be used to convert</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are also decorators for use with command handlers derived from <tt class="docutils literal">cmd.Cmd</tt>
which allow command strings to be automatically extracted from docstring help
text, allowing command parsing and completion to be transparently added to the
command-handling methods of the class.</p>
<p>To implement the <tt class="docutils literal">cmd.Cmd</tt> class, various methods of the form <tt class="docutils literal">do_XXX()</tt> are
implemented. To add the <tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser</tt> integration, these methods must contain a
docstring the first line(s) of which form a command specification as outlined
above, followed by a blank line and then any descriptive text for the operation
of the command. The prototype is also altered, taking three arguments - the
usual <tt class="docutils literal">self</tt> argument, a list of parsed command line items and a
<tt class="docutils literal">fields</tt> dictionary as demonstrated in the example immediately above.</p>
<p>Once the methods have been suitably modified, the <tt class="docutils literal">CmdMethodDecorator</tt>
decorator should be applied to each of them, and the <tt class="docutils literal">CmdClassDecorator</tt>
decorator should be applied to the class definition as a whole:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from cmdparser import cmdparser

&#64;cmdparser.CmdClassDecorator()
class CommandHandler(cmd.Cmd):

    &#64;cmdparser.CmdMethodDecorator():
    def do_command(self, args, fields):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;command ( add | delete ) &lt;name&gt;

        This is an example command to demonstrate use of the cmd
        decorators.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        # Method body goes here - it will only be called if a command
        # parses successfully according to the specification above.
</pre>
<p>Note that due to the design of the <tt class="docutils literal">cmd.Cmd</tt> class, the first token in the
specification must be the same as the method name after the <tt class="docutils literal">do_</tt> prefix. An
exception will be raised if this is not the case.</p>
<p>The method decorator adds some wrapper code which parses the entered command
according to the specification, and displays an error message if parsing fails.
Should parsing succeed, the implementation method itself is called with the
parsed arguments and fields passed as from the <tt class="docutils literal">check_match()</tt> method of the
parse tree. Note that when using these decorators, the <tt class="docutils literal">cmd.Cmd</tt> class
instance is passed as the <tt class="docutils literal">context</tt> parameter to many of the token methods,
which can be useful for recovering dynamic state.</p>
<p>The class decorator then adds tab-completion methods for every decorated
command method, so applications need not concern themselves with this at all.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to decorate every command method - for very simple commands
which take no arguments it may be simpler to leave them bare. In this case, of
course, the method prototype must match what is expected by <tt class="docutils literal">cmd.Cmd</tt>
(i.e. a single <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> parameter beyond the <tt class="docutils literal">self</tt> parameter). However,
if any method is decorated then the class decorator is required to add the
completion methods.</p>
<p>Finally, note that as a convenience the docstring help for commands has the
leading whitespace of the second line stripped from all lines (on the
assumption that the first line immediately follows a triple quote and hence has
no indentation). Lines are also wrapped to 80 columns in the help text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="datetimeparse">
<h1>datetimeparse</h1>
<p>Building on the parse trees within the <tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser</tt> module, this module adds
specific token types to parse human-readable specifications of date and time.
It allows both absolute and relative dates to be specified, and these are
converted to datetime and other instances as appropriate.</p>
<p>Some examples of the type of specifications supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">2:35pm on Wednesday last week</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">3 days, 2 hours and 5 minutes ago</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">3rd March 2012</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The following classes are currently defined:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">DateSubtree</tt></dt>
<dd>Parses a calendar date, including literal dates (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2012-06-15</span></tt>), descriptive
versions (<tt class="docutils literal">15th June 2012</tt>), days of the week relative to the current day
(<tt class="docutils literal">Thursday last week</tt>) as well as <tt class="docutils literal">yesterday</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">today</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">tomorrow</tt>. The returned value is a <tt class="docutils literal">datetime.date</tt> instance.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">TimeSubtree</tt></dt>
<dd>Parses a time of day in 12 or 24 hour format. The returned value is as
returned by <tt class="docutils literal">time.localtime()</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">RelativeTimeSubtree</tt></dt>
<dd>Parses phrases which indicate a time offset from the present time, such as
<tt class="docutils literal">3 days and 2 hours ago</tt>. The returned value is an instance of
<tt class="docutils literal">cmdparser.DateDelta</tt>, which is a wrapper class containing a
<tt class="docutils literal">datetime.timedelta</tt> and an additional offset in calendar months. It has
sufficient methods defined to allow it to be added or subtracted from
a <tt class="docutils literal">datetime.datetime</tt> in the same way as <tt class="docutils literal">datetime.timedelta</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">DateTimeSubtree</tt></dt>
<dd>Parses specifications of a date and time, accepting either a combination of
<tt class="docutils literal">DateSubtree</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">TimeSubtree</tt> phrases, or a <tt class="docutils literal">RelativeTimeSubtree</tt>
phrase; in the latter case the time is taken as relative to the current
time. The returned value is a <tt class="docutils literal">datetime.datetime</tt> instance.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">PastCalendarPeriodSubtree</tt></dt>
<dd>Parses specifications of calendar periods in the past. Examples of the
phrases this will accept include <tt class="docutils literal">last week</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">3 months ago</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">week containing 24th March 2012</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">between <span class="pre">2012-02-03</span> and today</tt>.
The returned value is a 2-tuple of <tt class="docutils literal">datetime.date</tt> instances representing
the range of dates specified, where the first date is inclusive and the
second exclusive.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the docstrings of the classes for more details and the <tt class="docutils literal">spec</tt> class
attribute for the complete specification of phrases that each class accepts.</p>
