Overview
========

A white-on-black theme for the Sphinx_ documentation generator. It has
slightly muted white text on various shades of dark grey. I created this
as I find light-on-dark themes typically easier on the eyes, since I tend
to use dark backgrounds on my terminals and I don't like flicking between
light and dark backgrounds frequently.

It uses a subtle text shadow and rounded corners to improve legibility, but
it should also render accpetably on browsers which don't support these CSS
features.

The theme should cover most common constructions, but it's possible there
are some classes I've missed. It also includes a Pygments theme which I
think complements it without being overly bright.
